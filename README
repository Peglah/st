st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.

Update custom branch
------------
Here’s a summarized workflow:
Update master branch with upstream changes:

    git checkout master
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/master
    git push origin master

Reapply patches on custom branch:

    git checkout custom
    git rebase master

If there are conflicts during the rebase, Git will prompt you to resolve them. Fix the conflicts in the affected files, then continue the rebase:

    git add <resolved-file>
    git rebase --continue

If you want to abort the rebase:

    git rebase --abort

Push your changes:

    git push origin custom
